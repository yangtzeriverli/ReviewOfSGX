# ReviewOfSGX
This is the review of SGX---you can put your work here--such as,the list of what you read and the main idea of the paper you read.Writing something down may be helpful to our later work,although i am not sure which language we will use(Chinese or English?),maybe Chinese is better for our assignments.
I have created the folder Hao and Qiang,you can put your work here.
